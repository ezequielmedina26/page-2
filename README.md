	THE RAGE OF DETERMINATION!!!!!!!! It's impossible to always have everything you want
	but you could always achieved and gain a lot of life. 
	I don't really care how many times I fell but each fall is just another step for life 
	another step to realize how I am not too limited to do anything on what's set in my mind.
	even though people around me laugh, scoff, and had very mean looks for some reason, i 
	didn't let that get to me, because im not doing this for anybody, im doing this for my 
	self. is times like these i wish i could fly away to my success.
